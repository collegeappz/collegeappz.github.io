<a name="about-us" class="anchor" href="#about-us"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About us</h3>

<p><a href="www.collegeappz.com">CollegeAppz</a> is an early stage startup addressing the needs of 20 million U.S. and
international high school students desiring to make smarter college choices. We're
building a “TurboTax for College Admissions,” an one-stop shop for the entire college
admissions and financial aid process.</p>

<p>Our beta went live in June 2013, and we’re gaining early traction and revenue. We're a
very small team with big plans for the future. We’ve had write-ups in the Chronicle of
Higher Education, TechCrunch, TechCocktail, and other news sources. We’ve been
featured in Women 2.0 (SF-based organization) and are partnering with the White
House and U.S. Department of Education for a DataJam event focused on building the
next generation of edtech tools.</p>

<a name="we-need-you" class="anchor" href="#we-need-you"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We need you!</h2>

<p>What we don’t have is a Chief Technology Officer (CTO). We need you! This opportunity
will be equity-only until we close our initial round of funding, after which you will be
compensated with a startup-competitive salary plus your equity.</p>

<h2>
<a name="what-you-can-do" class="anchor" href="#what-you-can-do"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What you can do</h2>

<p>The ideal candidate would have some background in edtech, specifically in white-label
SaaS platform with a large back-end database. If you have a strong design sensibility,
that's helpful too.</p>

<p>We're looking for a CTO who is comfortable addressing unique technological
challenges, building and leading teams, and who can help shape and effectively
translate the vision of CollegeAppz into the premier source to find, prepare, and apply
for college. </p>

<p>We want to build as close to a true “TurboTax for College Admissions”
platform as possible, integrating APIs or creatively pulling information from Pearson
(SIS system), College Navigator (college information database), Common Application
(college applications), Parchment (transcripts), FAFSA (financial aid), and other sources.
We also want to provide multilingual support to target the growing number of
immigrant, first-generation, and international students applying to U.S. colleges.</p>

<p>If you’ve worked at Naviance, Blackboard, 2tor, or another big education company, and
are looking to build the next generation platform for college bound students...we want
to talk to you!</p>

<p>Compensation options: Employee Equity</p>
