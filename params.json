{"name":"Collegeappz","tagline":"Do you want to help change the future of college admissions?","body":"### About us\r\nCollegeAppz is an early stage startup addressing the needs of 20 million U.S. and\r\ninternational high school students desiring to make smarter college choices. We're\r\nbuilding a “TurboTax for College Admissions,” an one-stop shop for the entire college\r\nadmissions and financial aid process.\r\n\r\nOur beta went live in June 2013, and we’re gaining early traction and revenue. We're a\r\nvery small team with big plans for the future. We’ve had write-ups in the Chronicle of\r\nHigher Education, TechCrunch, TechCocktail, and other news sources. We’ve been\r\nfeatured in Women 2.0 (SF-based organization) and are partnering with the White\r\nHouse and U.S. Department of Education for a DataJam event focused on building the\r\nnext generation of edtech tools.\r\n\r\n### We need you!\r\n\r\nWhat we don’t have is a Chief Technology Officer (CTO). We need you! This opportunity\r\nwill be equity-only until we close our initial round of funding, after which you will be\r\ncompensated with a startup-competitive salary plus your equity.\r\n\r\nThe ideal candidate would have some background in edtech, specifically in white-label\r\nSaaS platform with a large back-end database. If you have a strong design sensibility,\r\nthat's helpful too.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for a CTO who is comfortable addressing unique technological\r\nchallenges, building and leading teams, and who can help shape and effectively\r\ntranslate the vision of CollegeAppz into the premier source to find, prepare, and apply\r\nfor college. We want to build as close to a true “TurboTax for College Admissions”\r\nplatform as possible, integrating APIs or creatively pulling information from Pearson\r\n(SIS system), College Navigator (college information database), Common Application\r\n(college applications), Parchment (transcripts), FAFSA (financial aid), and other sources.\r\nWe also want to provide multilingual support to target the growing number of\r\nimmigrant, first-generation, and international students applying to U.S. colleges.\r\nIf you’ve worked at Naviance, Blackboard, 2tor, or another big education company, and\r\nare looking to build the next generation platform for college bound students...we want\r\nto talk to you!\r\n\r\nCompensation options: Employee Equity\r\n\r\n# Contact us today!\r\n\r\nFind us on twitter @collegeappz, email us <mailto:Tina@CollegeAppz>, or find us at www.collegeappz.com!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
